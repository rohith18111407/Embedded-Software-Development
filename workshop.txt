Batch - 8
Embedded Software Development Workshop 2022

Microcontroller   - can understand all the instructions and perform accordingly
			- portable
			- RAM, ROM, EPROM are present

Digital sensor - shows 0 and 1

Bread board - 4 sections

Exp -2
HIGH - blink the LED
	 OFF the LED

1. Go to tools and select board "Arduino uno".
2. After selection, compile and upload the code and check thr output. If the ouput shows error then select the board properly.

AO - Analog section pin
PWM - Pulse width Modulation
	- used only for the purpose of pulse width modulation
LDR - Light Dependent Resistor
	- used in the Street Light System

Pin 13 - default pin and it doesn't need any more connections

red- +ve
black -GND

L293 Motor Driver

- can connect simultaneously two DC Motors

DC Motor - delay is not possible

Servo motor - delay is possible

Exp - 7

1. Connect VE to VCC (+5V)
2.Connect A1, A2 of Joystick to Arduino A0,A1 respectively
3. Joystick pins must be kept at the bottom while operating

Exp - 8

1. Echo(input) to Digital pin D2 (RHS)
2. Trig(output) to Digital pin D3

- This is used to calculate the distance between the obstacle and the ultrasonic sensor

Note : 

- Always use rectangular surface for detecting in ultrasonic sensor

- Change the baud width to 96000 in serial monitor for checking the ultrasonic sensor

- Change the baud width to 1165000 in serial monitor for NodeMCU chip

- For making the model to turn right, keep the right DC motor off and then make the left motor to rotate.

- If no battery supply is given to the LC Driver Motor then it makes use of the system power.

- If u neec more VCC connection then use bread board, where VCC connection can be extracted by connection another wire in the
same potential.

- Male to female connecting wires consist of one side pin and another side without pin.
